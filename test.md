So to find this out, we did some research and according to Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum, ramen did really come from China. They were brought when Yokohama port is opened to the world in 1859 during Meiji period. During post-war, the settlements of immigrant lead to the formation of China towns and the lines of Chinese restaurants at the street risen the popularity of Chinese noodle.

So what’s the different between Japanese ramen and Chinese noodles? Technically it is not much different except that the soup or dashi used in the ramen is specifically made for ramen. The soup for chinese noodle is used in several other soup based Chinese dishes. The soup is actually the key factor of ramen and when you see Japanese Bangumi (TV show), it is always the thing they talked about when commenting the ramen.

The soup is generally comprised of soy sause, miso and animal based broth which is made by simmering pork or chicken bone. And for the toppings, typically they will put chashu (seasoned, roast pork), menma (seasoned bamboo shoots), green onion, soft-simmered egg, and nori (seaweed).

With so many animal and pork based ingredients, how are we supposed to eat ramen? Few years back it is almost impossible to find ramen in Japan that is halal to consume. But with the increasing of Muslim tourisms, there are ramen shop in big cities in Japan than serve only halal ramen. To make it halal, first, pork based meat and ingredients is not used at all. For the broth, chicken, fish and vegetables are used. There are already halal certified product like miso and soy sauce in Japan market now so they will use that as the soup seasoning.
